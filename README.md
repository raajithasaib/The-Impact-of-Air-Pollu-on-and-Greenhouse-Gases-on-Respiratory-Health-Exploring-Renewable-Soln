# The Impact of Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases on Respiratory Health: Exploring Renewable Solutions

## üìå Overview
This repository contains data analysis, visualizations, and research on the relationship between **greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and respiratory health**. The project explores trends in energy consumption, emissions, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions, highlighting their impacts on public health.

## üìä Research Questions
1. How have greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions evolved over time across different regions?
2. What is the relationship between **energy consumption by sector** and **GHG emissions**?
3. How do **CO‚ÇÇ emissions** vary by country, and which nations have historically contributed the most?
4. What impact does **renewable energy adoption** have on reducing GHG emissions and improving **public health**?
5. How do global warming potential (GWP) gases compare in their contributions to climate change?

## üìå Data Sources
- [EPA Energy Consumption Data](https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=93#1)
- [Our World in Data - Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions)
- [United Nations Climate Data](http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx)

## üìä Key Findings
- **Greenhouse gas emissions per capita** have been declining due to **renewable energy adoption** and efficiency improvements.
- The **industrial sector** was historically the highest energy consumer but has shifted toward **transportation and residential use**.
- High **global warming potential (GWP) gases**, such as **SF‚ÇÜ and PFC-14**, have a disproportionate effect on climate change despite their lower volume.
- The **electricity and transportation sectors** account for over **90% of total emissions**, making them key targets for climate action.
- **Countries with high renewable energy consumption** show significantly **lower air pollution-related mortality rates**.

## üìú Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering raw data from climate and public health databases.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removing inconsistencies and preparing structured datasets.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends in emissions, energy consumption, and health impacts.
4. **Visualization**: Creating charts and maps to illustrate key findings.
5. **Insights & Policy Recommendations**: Highlighting key takeaways and suggesting solutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis & visualization (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration
- **GitHub**: Version control & collaboration
